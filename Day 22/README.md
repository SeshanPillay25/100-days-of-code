# Tweet Tracker


## Tools:
- PyCharm (you can download the community edition https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
- Python libraries: tweepy,

## Getting started:

1. You're going to have to create a twitter developer account, this won't take that long, https://developer.twitter.com/
2. Once that's done, click "Create new application" and fill out the required info.
3. Once the application has been created, click the “Keys and Access Tokens” tab to get your consumer secret and consumer key, you will also need a pair of access tokens, scroll down and click the button "Generate tokens" and you should now have an access token and access token secret.  We’ll need all of that later, so make sure you keep that tab open.

Once that's done, open the file, enter your own keys and run it
